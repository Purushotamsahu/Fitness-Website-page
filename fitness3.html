        <li>If time is money, modern life is in debt, especially when it comes to finding time for the gym. But never fear: the full body workout is here. Doing exactly what you'd suspect, the full body workout combines a series of compound exercises (each targeting multiple muscle groups) to hit all the right spots in one session. Proponents of such a workout say this not only saves you precious time, but it can also help build consistent size and improve cardiovascular performance.

            But is this more holistic regime the right choice for everyone, and how do you make the most of your full-body experience? Luckily, we have some expert personal trainers on speed dial to talk you through the pros and cons of the full body workout – and guide you towards the right workout plan.</li>

                Professional Trainer:
                One of the advantages of training in a fitness center is you’ll get assistance from a professional trainer. Many gyms offer several classes that suit your needs.

                Working out can help you to maintain a healthy lifestyle. It also leads to healthy eating habits.

        <h6>Benefits of Fitness</h6>
        <ul>
            <li>Regular physical activity is one of the most important things you can do for your health. Being physically active can improve your brain health, help manage weight, reduce the risk of disease, strengthen bones and muscles, and improve your ability to do everyday activities.

                Adults who sit less and do any amount of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity gain some health benefits. Only a few lifestyle choices have as large an impact on your health as physical activity.
                
                Everyone can experience the health benefits of physical activity – age, abilities, ethnicity, shape, or size do not matter.
                
                Immediate Benefits
                Some benefits of physical activity on brain health [PDF-14.4MB] happen right after a session of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Benefits include improved thinking or cognition for children 6 to 13 years of age and reduced short-term feelings of anxiety for adults. Regular physical activity can help keep your thinking, learning, and judgment skills sharp as you age. It can also reduce your risk of depression and anxiety and help you sleep better</li>.
